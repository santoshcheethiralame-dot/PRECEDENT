"""The agent may not write outside the repository it was given.

A live run wrote phone_verified into seeds/clinic - the pristine corpus every
benchmark restores from - because `repo / path` is not a containment check:
Python drops the base when the right-hand side is absolute, and `..` walks out.
Contaminating the seeds changes what every future run measures, silently.
