"""Turn a verdict into an instruction the agent can actually execute.

A halt that says "do the missing work" is a verdict. A halt that says
"create migrations/002_phone_verified.sql" is an instruction. Small models act
on the second and stall on the first - and an agent that stalls after a block
has been stopped without being improved, which is the whole point missed.

The suggestion is derived from the repository, never invented: the naming
convention comes from the files already sitting in the required directory.
