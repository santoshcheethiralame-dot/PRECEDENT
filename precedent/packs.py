"""The mistakes every coding agent makes, that every user recognises.

Mined rules describe one repository's habits. These are different: they are the
failures that show up everywhere, and a person should not have to be burned by
them once each before the tool knows about them.

Two tiers, and the split is about false positives rather than severity:

  BINDING     the pattern is unambiguous. A live AWS key is never intentional,
              and `pdb.set_trace()` is never meant to be committed.
  ADVISORY    the pattern is usually wrong but legitimately happens - tests do
              get deleted during real refactors - so it informs and does not
              block. `precedent on <n>` promotes it if you disagree.

Every rule here is installed only when the repository shows it applies, and
every one can be switched off.
