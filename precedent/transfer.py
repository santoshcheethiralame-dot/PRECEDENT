"""Cross-repo precedent.

A lesson learned in one repository is worth something in the next one, but not
immediately: one repo's layout is not evidence about another's. The rule here is
deliberately conservative — a holding only becomes GLOBAL once the same rule has
been derived independently in two different repositories. One sighting is a
local habit; two is a pattern.

The global ledger is an ordinary ledger at ~/.precedent/global.db, so everything
that reads a ledger already reads this.
