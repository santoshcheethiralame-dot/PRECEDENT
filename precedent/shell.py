"""Every subprocess we launch, launched the same way.

PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE matters more than it looks. A .pyc records the source
mtime to one-second granularity, and these runs write a file and import it
inside the same second - so Python cannot tell the cache is stale and serves
the PREVIOUS version of the module. A failing run then reads the last run's
field list and its oracle passes. Bytecode caching quietly inverts the result.
