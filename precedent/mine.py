"""What this repository already knows about itself.

An empty ledger is useless on day one, and a solo developer will not wait to
fail four times before the tool earns its place. Every repository already
carries its own conventions in two places nobody reads: its commit history, and
whatever it declares to its own CI.

The naive version of this does not work. "These two directories always change
together" is true of every pair in a repository whose first commit added
everything, and it is equally true in both directions when two things genuinely
move as one. Both failures were measured before this was written.

So a pairing has to survive three tests:

  support     seen together often enough to be a habit, not a coincidence
  confidence  P(B | A) - touching A really does mean touching B
  asymmetry   P(A | B) is LOW - otherwise the two simply move together and the
              data cannot tell you which one is the trigger

The last one is the interesting one, and it is also the fix for the only
false positive the benchmark could not explain.
