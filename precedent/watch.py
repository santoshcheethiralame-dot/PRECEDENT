"""Watch a working tree and show every decision as it happens.

This is the harness-agnostic path, and it is the important one. A plugin has to
be written per agent - opencode, Cursor, Claude Code, whatever comes next - and
each one is a separate thing to maintain and a separate thing to be broken by an
upstream change.

A working tree is a working tree. `precedent watch` looks at git, not at the
agent, so it works with every one of them at once, and with a person typing by
hand. The plugin remains worth having for one reason only: it can stop a write
before it lands. The watcher can only report - but it reports everything.
