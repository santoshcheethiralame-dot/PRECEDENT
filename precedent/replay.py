"""Record one real session so the desk has something to show with no service.

The desk is a live view of `precedent watch`. Nobody opening the static site
is going to start a watcher, so the only state it ever showed was `dormant` -
a clerk doing nothing, on the page that is supposed to demonstrate the tool.

This records a genuine session instead of faking one. It drives the same
`watch._report` the live watcher drives, against a real ledger with real
binding precedents, and captures exactly what `serve.emit` produced. The
playback pacing is ours; every event in the file was emitted by the product.

    python -m precedent replay

writes web/replay.json and puts the repository back as it found it.
