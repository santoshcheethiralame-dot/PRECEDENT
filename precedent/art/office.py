"""The records office, drawn as data.

Same method as the clerk: every pixel placed here, in the same palette, at the
same scale. Shop-bought sprite packs were considered and rejected - they carry
their own palette and their own light source, and a room assembled from two
sources reads as assembled.

    python -m precedent.art.office

writes web/sprites/office.png, office@4x.png and office.json.

Two rules hold this together. The light comes from the upper left, so every
solid is drawn with cv.box() and gets a lit edge and a shadowed one - a flat
fill is what makes pixel art look like a placeholder. And nothing here carries
text: labels belong to the page, which can change them, not to a sprite that
cannot.
